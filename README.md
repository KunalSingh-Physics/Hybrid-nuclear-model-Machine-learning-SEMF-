# Hybrid-nuclear-model-Machine-learning-SEMF-
We first make a theoretical model(using Semi empirical mass formula) and a machine learning model, we compare their results and then finally we use the predictions from the theoretical model as a feature for a new ML model we call this the hybrid model. We finally compare the accuracy of these models.
